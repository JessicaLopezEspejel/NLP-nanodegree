## Project description

In this project we built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part of speech tagging using Brown corpus.

We worked with [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate). 
It is library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf).

**Note:** You can download a copy of the original project from GitHub [here](https://github.com/udacity/hmm-tagger) 
and then run a Jupyter server locally with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Dataset

We used a copy of the [Brown corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/brown-corpus). Brown is a dataset originally from [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/). 

## Results

The model achieved >96% tag accuracy.
